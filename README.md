Real Time Bus Tracker

Description

The Real Time Bus Tracker is a program that uses MBTA bus data to determine the bus stops between MIT’s campus and Harvard’s campus. A icon starts at the bus stop closes to MIT’s campus then moves along each stop until it reaches the bus stop closes to Harvard’s campus, where it stops.

How to Run

Fork and clone this repo. Once the files are downloaded load the HTML file in a Web Browser. Click on the ‘Show stops between MIT and Harvard’ button. Watch as the icon moves along the bus stops from MIT to Harvard.
